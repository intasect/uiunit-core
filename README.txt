Welcome to the Cordys UIUnit-Core
====================================
Cordys UIUnit-Core is a JUnit based framework aimed at improving the quality of front-end pages and increasing developer productivity.
Some of the salient features of UIUnit are:
1) Understands all Cordys UI libraries & AJAX framework
2) Tests on element level rather than on pixel level
3) It is Junit based, hence easily pluggable into build process
4) The test cases are independent of OS and browser type.
